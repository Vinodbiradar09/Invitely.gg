# Contributing to Invitely.gg

Thanks for your interest in contributing. We value **clarity, correctness, and simplicity** over cleverness.

## Development Philosophy

- Server-first architecture
- Explicit data flow
- Minimal abstractions
- Type safety across all boundaries
- Predictable performance over premature optimization

Changes that violate these principles will likely be rejected.

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.

2. **Create a feature branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Set up your environment** — copy `.env.example` or refer to the README.

5. **Make your changes**, keeping commits focused and atomic.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`
- Prefer server components; use `"use client"` only when necessary
- Co-locate types with the code that uses them
- Name things clearly; avoid abbreviations
